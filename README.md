# About me! 

I'm an electronic engineer with a focus in software engineering. I have an intense enthusiasm for using the node ecosystem to build apps and for writing clean, efficient code. Learning new things and making video games are my hobbies.

## What I'm up to

Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills as a software engineer and contributing to open source projects whenever I can. I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects to work on and challenging problems to solve.

## What drives me

I'm driven by the opportunity to create software that makes people's lives easier and improves their quality of life. I believe that technology can be a force for good and I'm excited to be a part of the community of developers who are making a positive impact in the world.
